php-messaging
-------------

A set of libraries to build messaging applications using Enterprise Integrations Patterns. 
It is based on STOMP and ActiveMQ. It offers a higher level of abstraction:
* message content-type recognition (now json and text are handled)
* classes to define channel types
* channel and message correlation

(Codehaus STOMP libraries included)

Enterprise Integration Patterns
-------------------------------

These are implemented:
* Fire and forget pattern
* Request/Reply pattern


TODO
----
* use PECL Stomp extension for better performance
